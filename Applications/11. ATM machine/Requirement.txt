2 design patterns used in this -> state design pattern and chain of responsibility design pattern

flow :
    - user with card
    - insert card
    - authenticate pin
    - operations options
    - perform operation
    - user with card


States of ATM -> IdleState, HasCardState, SelectionState, PerformOperationState

Operations -> Authenticate, checkBalance, withdraw,......


where chain of responsibility is used?
At cash withdraw operation ->
    - lets say there are 3 types of notes > 2000, 500 and 100
    - if we want 3000 rs -> we'll get 2k 1 note and 500 2 notes
    - this is where chain of responsibility is used.
    - if 1 processor is not able to do then it tells other to do (2k not able to do -> it will tell 500 to do)
