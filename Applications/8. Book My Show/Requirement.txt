First question will be about design of book my show and then concurrency (what will you do in case of 2 users click on same seat at same place)

check pdf and code for design
- there can be 1 more controller BookingController which will handle all the booking stuff

concurrency:
    1. if both select at same time then, what to do
    2. keep seat book for 5 mins when user selects book seat

    There are 2 types of lock.
       1. Optimistic
           - It allows multiple users to read at same time
           - At the time of update, checks version of the row(seat)
           - if version is higher -> throws error for refresh -> read again
           - if version is same -> acquire lock and update the row version -> release lock
       2. Pessimistic
           - When 1 user read, at that acquire the lock.
           - update it and release the lock

For bookMyShow -> Optimistic locking will be better.
    because traffic is more, cannot show all seat full.


Timer at locking can be achieved at redis.
Redis allows to give timing(Expiry Time) to lock
